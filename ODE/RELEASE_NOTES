Apache ODE Release Notes
========================

Apache ODE 1.3.3 is a security release for the process deployment web
service, which was sensible to deployment messages with forged names.
It also includes a few bug fixes and improvements.

Apache ODE 1.3.3 requires Java 1.5.x. The WAR distribution can run in
most J2EE servlet container. The JBI distribution should be able to
run in any JBI container but has only been tested with ServiceMix
3.1 so far. See the BUILDING file if you want to build your own
distribution from the source release.
